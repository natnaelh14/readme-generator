## Description
This is a readme file generator node application. To achieve this, I first created a question bank and stored 
them in an array of objects. i used the 'validate' keyword from inquirer npm to create conditionals for each 
question. I then created a function to generate the readme content by utilizing user's answers. I used the 
'prompt' method from inquirer npm to handle the question invocation. Finally, i used 'fs.writefile' to create 
a readme file and add the generated content to file. I appreciate any feedback, Thanks.
